              Question-1: What are the different ways to select an element in the DOM?

            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                There are several methods to select elements in the DOM using JavaScript. The most common ones include getElementById() for selecting by ID, getElementsByClassName() for selecting by class name, getElementsByTagName() for selecting by tag name, querySelector() for selecting using CSS selectors, and querySelectorAll() for selecting multiple elements. Each method has its specific use cases and performance characteristics depending on your needs.

            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                innerHTML returns or sets the HTML content inside an element, including all HTML tags. innerText returns or sets the visible text content, respecting styling and excluding hidden elements. textContent returns or sets all text content including hidden elements but excluding HTML tags. Understanding these differences is crucial for proper DOM manipulation and avoiding security vulnerabilities like XSS attacks.

              Question-3: What is event delegation in the DOM?
            </h2>
            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element to handle events for its child elements. This takes advantage of event bubbling, where events propagate up the DOM tree. It's particularly useful for handling events on dynamically created elements and improving performance by reducing the number of event listeners needed.

            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Event bubbling is the process where an event starts from the target element and bubbles up through its parent elements in the DOM hierarchy. When an event occurs on an element, it first runs the handlers on that element, then on its parent, then all the way up to the document object. This behavior can be controlled using stopPropagation() method and is fundamental to understanding event delegation patterns.

              Question-5: How do you create and append elements to the DOM?
            </h2>
            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Creating and appending elements involves using document.createElement() to create new elements, setting their properties and content, and then using methods like appendChild(), insertBefore(), or append() to add them to the DOM. You can also set attributes, add event listeners, and modify styling before or after appending. Modern approaches also include using insertAdjacentHTML() for inserting HTML strings at specific positions.

              Question-6: What are the differences between var, let, and const in JavaScript?
            </h2>
            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                var has function scope and is hoisted, allowing redeclaration and reassignment. let has block scope, is hoisted but not initialized (temporal dead zone), allows reassignment but not redeclaration in the same scope. const also has block scope, must be initialized at declaration, and cannot be reassigned (though objects and arrays can be mutated). Understanding these differences is essential for writing reliable JavaScript code and avoiding common pitfalls.
